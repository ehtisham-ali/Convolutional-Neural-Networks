# Convolutiional Neural Networks - 

In this project, a comparision of CNN with simple densely connected neural network is performed. CNN performs better on images as compared to simply densely connected network. Convolution Neural Network can detect more of the spatial features compared to densely connected network. In densely connected network the spatial relations between neighboring pixels is lost where as in convolution neural netrwork due to convolution operation the local information of pixels is preserved. This comparision is shown on MNIST fashion dataset using tensorflow and keras.
